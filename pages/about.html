                Hello and welcome! 
                <br><br>
                Thank you for stopping by; here’s a little about me, how I practice and what you can expect out of therapy. I’m Ana, and I’m a Registered Professional Counsellor - Candidate. I use a mix of person-centered therapy, Cognitive Behavioural therapy, existential therapy and solution focused therapy to support clients. Each client is unique and varying circumstances require varying approaches. I like to think of therapy as a journey that the client takes on which I’m there to support them. I also like to incorporate the client’s cultural traditions and practices into therapy, which I’ve found can really help clients to ease into therapy. 
                <br><br>
                What you can expect out of therapy with me: in the first session or two I’ll conduct an assessment to get an idea about what brings you to therapy and what you wish to achieve out of it. Then, we’ll start our work together to understand what you most need support with, what isn’t working for you, and which measures to take to make things better for you! We will look at what in your life you differently. How would you want your life to look like if that issue or hindrance was not there. Then, we will try to figure out what barriers stop us from making those changes and living the life we want to live and thrive in. And slowly we start working on taking small steps toward the life you want to have. Progress can be seen when you start to feel the problem or the problem areas start to feel better, there’s improvement in the areas of life you hoped for and your thoughts and emotions about those feel more regulated. All of this sounds very linear, but therapy is rarely a linear process. Any time we face a hurdle, we’ll get back to the drawing board and try another way. Remember, throughout therapy you will need to be patient with yourself and the process. I will be there to support you throughout the process. Together, we will make it work :)
