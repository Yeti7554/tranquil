                Hello and welcome! 
                <br><br>
                Thank you for stopping by; here’s a little about me, how I practise and what you can expect out of counselling services. I am Ana, and I am a Registered Professional Counsellor - Candidate. I use a mix of person-centered therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, existential therapy and solution-focused therapy to support clients. Each client is unique, and therefore requires varying approaches. I like to think of therapy as a journey undertaken by the client for which I am the guide and a support system. I like to incorporate the client’s cultural values and practices into therapy, which according to me play a big role in successful counselling outcomes.
                <br><br>
                <strong>What you can expect from counselling sessions with me:</strong>
                <br>
                In the first session or two I will conduct an assessment for your counselling needs and what you wish to achieve out of it. Then, we will start working together to understand which areas in your life require to be given immediate attention. We will explore which areas in your life you want to make changes to and how your life would look like with these changes. Then, we will try to figure out what barriers stop us from making those changes and living the life we want to live and thrive in. And gradually we will start working on taking small steps toward the life you want. Progress can be seen when you start to realize the problem areas and they dont seem as overwhelming to hinder your day to day life. You see an improvement in yourself and feel at ease with your thoughts and emotions. All of this sounds very linear, but therapy is rarely a linear process. Any time we face a hurdle, we will get back to the drawing board and try another way. Remember, throughout the therapy you will need to be patient with yourself and the process. I will be there to support you throughout. Together, we will make it work :)
